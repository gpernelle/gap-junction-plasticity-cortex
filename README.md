## Abstract
Cortical oscillations are thought to be involved in many cognitive 
functions and processes. Several mechanisms have been proposed to 
regulate oscillations. One prominent but understudied mechanism is 
gap-junctional coupling. Gap junctions are ubiquitous in cortex 
between GABAergic interneurons. Moreover, recent experiments indicate 
their strength can be modified in an activity-dependent manner, 
similar to chemical synapses. We hypothesized that activity-dependent 
gap junction plasticity acts as a mechanism to regulate oscillations 
in the cortex. We developed a computational model of gap junction 
plasticity in a recurrent cortical network. We showed that 
gap junction plasticity can serve as a homeostatic mechanism 
for oscillations 
by maintaining a tight balance between two network states: 
asynchronous irregular activity and synchronized oscillations. 
This homeostatic mechanism allows for robust communication between 
neuronal assemblies through two different mechanisms: transient 
oscillations and frequency modulation. This implies a direct 
functional role for gap junction plasticity in information 
transmission in cortex.
